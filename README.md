# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Happiness Index Correlation

This repository contains an analysis of COVID-19 data with a focus on identifying potential correlations between the maximum infection rate in a country and that country's happiness index scores. The study seeks to shed light on the complex relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and societal well-being.

## Analysis Highlights

The analysis includes the following key findings:

1. **GDP vs. Maximum Infection Rate:** We explore the relationship between a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its maximum infection rate during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing valuable insights into the economic impact of the virus.

2. **Social Support vs. Maximum Infection Rate:** Investigating how the level of social support within a country correlates with the maximum infection rate, helping us understand the role of social structures in dealing with a health crisis.

3. **Healthy Life Expectancy vs. Maximum Infection Rate:** We examine the connection between a nation's healthy life expectancy and its maximum infection rate, offering insights into the healthcare aspects of pandemic response.

4. **Freedom to Make Life Choices vs. Maximum Infection Rate:** This analysis delves into the relationship between personal freedoms and the impact on a country's maximum infection rate during the pandemic.
